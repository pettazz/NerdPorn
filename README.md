It's like statsd but probably not as good.


Why reinvent the wheel? Everyone knows about statsd (https://github.com/etsy/statsd/) and how awesome it is, so why the hell would I need to make my own less-good version? Because I'm here to learn, jackass, and the best way to learn is to just jump in and hack on some shit. So here we are.
